# Trivia Game Coding Challenge

## Overview

Your challenge is to create a 10 question, true or false, trivia app in React Web. **You should not just implement the most basic solution. This is a chance to show off your abilities and impress.**

**The application code will be reviewed and scored on these key areas with many subset areas for each:**

- Functionality
- Code Format
- Project Structure
- Scalability
- Maintainability
- Use of industry best practices

Some specific things that we are looking for:

- Effective state management
- Navigation solution
- Componentization
- Best practices with API calls and data
- Separation of concerns between business and UI logic

## Goals

Implement the screens based off the wireframes, HTML/CSS starter code and api below using **advanced techniques** and **industry best practices** for your platform. Use your best judgment for UI/UX implementation. We have provided boilerplate code for a standard CRA project with Redux. In addition, we have given you some starter HTML and CSS in the designs folder. You can reference those as a starting place for your layout. We want to see how you structure the rest of the project and what tooling you use from here.

## Specifications

Layout:

See the designs folder for basic HTML and CSS already provided

Data:

The api url is: https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&difficulty=hard&type=boolean
